# Adopt a Pet - React Router Project
Adopt a Pet is a react app which I created for a challenge project as part of [Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

In this project, I practiced using React Router v6 to add client-side routing to a React Application. I worked on a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

You can view the project live at https://adopt-a-pet-router.netlify.app/



## Tasks

The objective of this project was to add client-side routing to the application using React Router so that: 

- The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.

- The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.

- The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.

- When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.

- When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.

- From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Home” button that will take them to the root path page.
